# icons

Icons and emojis add a touch of personality and clarity to your docs.  
They make your content easier to scan, more memorable, and sometimes just… more fun. 

---

## Purpose

- Add **visual cues** that guide readers through the page  
- Make headings, tips, and notes **pop** with personality  
- Use **standardized icons** for consistency across docs  

---

## Features

- **Built-in icon search** powered by [Material Design Icons](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/icons-emojis/)  
- **Thousands of icons** ready to use — just drop them in  
- **Emoji shortcodes** supported out of the box (`:sparkles:` → ✨)  
- **Custom overrides** possible if you want your own icon set  

---

## Configuration

Enable icons in your `mkdocs.yml` (most features are on by default):

```yaml
theme:
  icon:
    repo: fontawesome/brands/github
